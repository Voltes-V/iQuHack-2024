# iQuHack-2024
This repo is created for the MIT iQuHack 2024 Remote Hackathon.
Most of the code will be in Python.

The code is done in collaboration with Yi Tan, Aparna Gupta, Barnald's group. Additionally, the code takes the template given by Quandela's Perceval repository.
In order to optimize the code, we took the route of using NOR gates to optimize the output. Sadly, the code was not finished in time.
